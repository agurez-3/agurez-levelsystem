# Agurez Level System

This is a edited version of the Luctus Levelsystem system originally created by **(Overlordakise)**.  
The core system remains unchanged server-side, while the client-side code has been improved for better UI behavior, responsiveness, and compatibility with modern GMod clients.

- Improved clientside performance and stability
- Optimized UI elements for better display and interaction
- Fully compatible with the original server-side system
